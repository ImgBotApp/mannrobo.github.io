# About
Don't Forget to Breath (then called Flower Power) was a new team in StarStruck, Mannâ€™s third team overall. The team is comprised of a group of girls with a passion for STEM. They successfully competed at many competitions, garning many wins, and competed at the State Competition.

Now, In the Zone presents many challenges, but they are ready to face them. Stay tuned for their debut in November or December
