      <description>&lt;p&gt;Flower Power is a new team this season, Mann’s third team overall. The team is comprised of a group of girls with a passion for STEM. So far, the robot is assembled and ready to rock at a tournament. They will be participating in Starstruck tournaments in early February.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mann Made has been sending robots to the competition since 2014 during the Skyrise season. They started out as the sole pioneer team for our club without much experience. During their first season, we designed a Skyrise robot that focused on bringing cubes back to their alliance station. They went to only one tournament that year and didn’t earn any awards. While the robot wasn’t as neat as that of other teams, it was a good starting point for us and gave us a lot of valuable experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next year, their team started again with an influx of new members. The game for that season was Nothing But Net. They designed a robot that could collect balls off of the ground and shoot them from anywhere on the field using a flywheel. Fortunately, their Nothing But Net robot was very successful − it worked and was a valuable asset for potential alliance partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year we are participating again in VRC Starstruck. With some members graduating and others coming in, we’ve experienced some turnover. However, we have a strong team with members that possess a broad spectrum of skills. Our robot this year features a catapult-style design and will shoot stars and cubes over the fence. They will be participating in tournaments in early February.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some Assembly Required (3796B)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some Assembly Required was created at JL Mann in 2015. However, several member of the team have been working together for much longer, having competed in FLL together. They got a late start in the 2015-2016 season, not even starting until October, but they managed to pull through, helping Mann Robotics host a tournament that February. In that tournament, they proved our own, qualifying not only for the state level competition, but also for a national level competition in Nevada that they were unfortunately unable to attend.
With just three weeks between our first competition and state, the team was suddenly, and unexpectedly faced with a serious challenge. Their robot began to show signs of of severe technical issues. Increasing their meeting schedule from one or two to five meetings a week, and burning the midnight oil outside of meetings, they managed to get our robot into mostly working order, and performed adequately at state.
With renewed determination, we have increased our work ethic this year, starting earlier and meeting more often. The team has the strength of personal commitment and time investment.&lt;/p&gt;
